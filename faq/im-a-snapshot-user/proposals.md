<summary><strong>Can I create a proposal?</strong></summary>

It depends on the space settings. Spaces can set up a validation strategy which defines who is eligible to create a proposal, for example you need to hold at least 1ETH in your wallet in order to do so. Moreover, spaces can specify a list of users who can create proposals by listing their wallet addresses in the space settings. You can read more about [space settings](https://docs.snapshot.org/spaces/settings)  and [proposal validation](https://docs.snapshot.org/strategies/what-is-a-strategy-1).
