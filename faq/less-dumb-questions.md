# Strategies

## I have updated my strategy, when the changes will take effect ?

Once a proposal is created, if you change strategies, it will take effect from next proposal - It will not affect previous proposal.

## May I use different chains / networks in a strategy ?

Yes you can use multichain strategy in your space, which can calculate voting power from multiple networks.
