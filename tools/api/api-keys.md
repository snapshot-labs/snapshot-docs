# API Keys

We want to ensure that we limit the risk of API downtime and provide a reliable and continuous service. Therefore we decided to implement API Keys to ensure that the requests come from genuine users.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use **the same API key** for different Snapshot APIs.\
\
Limits are **counted individually** per each API Service.
{% endhint %}

## Limits

**ðŸ”“ No API Key:** 100 requests per minute.

**ðŸ”‘ With the API Key:** 2 million requests per month.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are getting **close to 2M requests a month** contact our support on [Help Center](https://help.snapshot.org/en/)
{% endhint %}

## How can I get an API Key?

### 1. Apply via the request form

If you havenâ€™t already please **fill in the below form** or submit it via [the direct link](https://tally.so/r/3laKWp).

#### API Key Request Form

{% embed url="https://tally.so/r/3laKWp" %}

### 2. Wait 72 hours

We will review your submission and **whitelist the address** you provided in the form.

**After 72 hours** have passed you can continue with the next steps. If you get any errors while generating the key, please contact our support on [Help Center](https://help.snapshot.org/en/).

### 3. Generate the API Key

After your address has been whitelisted go to [https://app.mycrypto.com/sign-message](https://app.mycrypto.com/sign-message) and connect your wallet using the account you provided in the submission form above.

#### a) Sign the message with keyword `generateKey:`

b) Copy the signature and run the below `curl` command.&#x20;

```javascript
curl --location 'https://keycard.snapshot.org' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "generate_key",
    "params": {
        "sig": "<SIGNATURE_HASH>"
    },
    "id": "123456789"
}'
```

Make sure to use the signature hash from step 5 in the `sig` param, **do not paste** the entire response after signing the message. As an example:

```javascript
...
    "method": "generate_key",
    "params": {
        "sig": "0x85bcabdeb3b43131364d21b32f8c74124d155009fc9d6d40901b4b725f23e0ac632808ebb00f3569bf875ded07b61ac5163ebe757b0897278ab276cdc982e3001c"
    },
...
```

You will receive the API Key as a response of the `curl` request. Make sure to store it securely.

## How to structure the query with my key?

The only change you need to make is to add the API Key in the headers of your request:

```bash
curl 'https://hub.snapshot.org/graphql?' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"\n{\n space(id:\"snapshot.dcl.eth\"){\n  id\n  name\n  members\n}\n}","variables":null}' \
  --compressed
```

Alternatively, you can use the `apiKey` param in the query string with your key as a value:

```bash
curl 'https://hub.snapshot.org/graphql?apiKey=<YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"\n{\n space(id:\"snapshot.dcl.eth\"){\n  id\n  name\n  members\n}\n}","variables":null}' \
  --compressed
```

If you are using the GraphQL interface you need to provide your key in the `headers` tab:
