# API Keys

We want to ensure that we limit the risk of API downtime and provide a reliable and continuous service. Therefore we decided to implement API Keys to ensure that the requests come from genuine users.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use **the same API key** for different Snapshot APIs.\
\
Limits are **counted individually** per each API Service.
{% endhint %}

## Limits

**🔓 No API Key:** 100 requests per minute.

**🔑 With the API Key:** 2 million requests per month.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are getting **close to 2M requests a month** contact our support on [Help Center](https://help.snapshot.org/en/)
{% endhint %}

## How can I get an API Key?

### 1. Apply via the request form

If you haven’t already please **fill in the below form** or submit it via [the direct link](https://tally.so/r/3laKWp).

#### API Key Request Form

{% embed url="https://tally.so/r/3laKWp" %}

### 2. Wait 72 hours

We will review your submission and **whitelist the address** you provided in the form.

Once whitelisted, you will **receive an email with your API key**. If you haven't received an email after 72 hours, please contact our support on [Help Center](https://help.snapshot.org/en/).


## How to structure the query with my key?

The only change you need to make is to add the API Key in the headers of your request:

```bash
curl 'https://hub.snapshot.org/graphql?' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"\n{\n space(id:\"snapshot.dcl.eth\"){\n  id\n  name\n  members\n}\n}","variables":null}' \
  --compressed
```

Alternatively, you can use the `apiKey` param in the query string with your key as a value:

```bash
curl 'https://hub.snapshot.org/graphql?apiKey=<YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"\n{\n space(id:\"snapshot.dcl.eth\"){\n  id\n  name\n  members\n}\n}","variables":null}' \
  --compressed
```

If you are using the GraphQL interface you need to provide your key in the `headers` tab:
