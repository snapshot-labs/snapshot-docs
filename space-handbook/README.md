{% hint style="info" %}
**This handbook uses terms like** [**Voting**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] **and** [**Validation strategies**](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]**,** [**Voting types**](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]**.** \
\
Make sure to learn about those concepts before diving into this chapter! \

ðŸ‘‰ [Voting strategies](../user-guides/strategies/voting-strategies.md)\
ðŸ‘‰ [Validation strategies](../user-guides/strategies/validation-strategies.md)\
ðŸ‘‰ [Voting t](../user-guides/proposals/voting-types.md)[ypes](../user-guides/proposals/voting-types.md)\

We also recommend going through the entire [Spaces](../user-guides/spaces/) guide to get acquainted with the process of [creating a Space](../user-guides/spaces/create/) and updating its [settings](../user-guides/spaces/settings.md).
{% endhint %}

This section will help you **combine Voting types, Validation, and Voting strategies** based on your organization's needs. We will look into:

* [Most common configurations](most-common.md)
* [Voting threshold](voting-threshold.md)
* [Anti-whale solutions](anti-whale.md)
* [Sybil resistance mechanisms, scam & spam prevention](sybil-resistance-scam-and-spam-prevention.md)
* [Delegation setups](delegation.md)
* [Liquidity / staking pool token voting](liquidity-staking-pool.md)
* [NFT voting](nft-voting/)
* [Custom calculations](custom-calculations.md)

If none of the above are a good fit for your Space, we encourage you to use the **Search** feature of this documentation with the **Lens** option selected to ask a question and receive a human-friendly answer :wink:
