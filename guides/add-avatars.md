# Add avatars

To get a logo for your space, images you need to do a pull request on this repository:

{% embed url="https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-spaces" %}

#### Follow the Snapshot spaces directory tree

```bash
└── spaces
    └── my-space.eth
        ├── logo.png
        └── space.png    
```

### **Add your space logo and strategy image\(s\)**

You will need to create a folder with the id of your space \(example: "my-space.eth"\). In this folder you need a file "space.png" and "logo.png" \(for the first strategy\) and "logo1.png" if you have a second strategy.

All the images must be squared and less than 50kb.

After committing your PR, you will have to wait for the merge of your PR to be able to see your images live. This process can take a few hours.
