# Gnosis Safe

You can use a Gnosis Safe to vote, create a proposal or setup a space on Snapshot. To do so you can login to Snapshot from Gnosis Safe UI by adding [https://snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org) as a Safe app. When you will try an action like vote, it will create a pending transaction in your Safe transactions queue. This transaction must be confirmed by the Safe signers within 72 hours. Once the transaction is confirmed the vote will be sent and will appear on the proposal.
