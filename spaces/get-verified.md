# Space verification

## Verification for legitimacy

Space verification is a process of checking if the space is real and can be trusted.&#x20;

Verified spaces have a special badge next to their name, as presented on the screenshot below.

Don't worry if you voted on a proposal of a fake space - signing a message doesn't cause any implications for you.
{% endhint %}

## How to get your space verified?

Make sure to follow all steps from the below checklist:

* Space has an **avatar** image uploaded
* Space has a minimum threshold for **proposal validation** (or limited to authors)
* There are at least **5 closed proposals**
* A **link** from the official website, the **GitHub** organization or a **tweet** to confirm the ownership of the Snapshot space
* **Ask to get verified** by an admin in [`#helpdesk`](https://discord.com/channels/707079246388133940/1055816513677967401) channel on [Discord](https://discord.snapshot.org)

Verification process can last up to 72 hours.
