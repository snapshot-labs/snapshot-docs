# Alternative way to create a space

If you do not want to have the wallet control your settings, you can follow the steps below to create a space on Snapshot.

### **Drawbacks**

* You will not be able to change settings from the UI
* Every time you want to change the settings, you will need to broadcast a new transaction

### **How to Create Space**

* Create a json file for your settings on Snapshot. The format of json file could be as follows: ****[https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot.js/blob/master/test/examples/space.json](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot.js/blob/master/test/examples/space.json)
* Store the json file on IPFS
* Use the IPFS link on the ENS text record. This will make the ENS owner the only  controller of the settings. ****
