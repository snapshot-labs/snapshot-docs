# Migrate or delete or a space

Currently, migrating and deleting spaces still requires some manual effort.&#x20;

## Delete a space

To ensure that the request to delete a space is legitimate, please create a proposal with the title "Delete this space" from the controller of the space (the Ethereum address that is registered in the `snapshot` ENS text record.

### One last step

Get in touch with @space-lead on our [Discord server](https://discord.snapshot.org/).\
Please allow a couple of days for the workflow to be processed.

In the future, there will be an option in the settings, to delete a space.

## Migrate a space

Create a proposal on the source space as well as on the target space with the title "Migrate this space" from the respective controllers of the spaces (the Ethereum address that is registered in the `snapshot` ENS text record).
