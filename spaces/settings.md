## Proposal validation

To validate if someone can post a proposal or not you can use the basic validation by default which takes your voting power with space strategies and checks if you pass a defined threshold.

## Voting

The voting delay is a value in time for which the proposal is in pending state, before the active state of the proposal when voters are able to cast a vote. The voting period is the duration that the proposal is active and votes can be casted.

Quorum is the amount of voting power collectively achieved by voters for a proposal to pass.

You can enable voting with session keys thanks to which the user won't be asked for a signature if they have already connected their wallet. This setting also affects creating and deleting proposals.
