# SafeSnap - oSnap

“oSnap” is short for Optimistic Snapshot Execution. oSnap lets DAOs propose transactions, do an off-chain governance vote, and have the transaction data submitted in a trustless fashion.

## Instructions for using oSnap: <a href="#e132" id="e132"></a>

Setting up the oSnap module:
* Create a Safe and Snapshot Space, or connect to your current accounts. 
* Go to Safe Apps, install the Zodiac app, and install the oSnap module through Zodiac.
* Set the proposal bond, challenge period, and Snapshot Space.
* Link the oSnap module to your Snapshot Space with SafeSnap.
* Your oSnap module address is added to the SafeSnap plugin configuration to enforce the results of proposals on-chain.

Using oSnap with Snapshot:
* Create a proposal and Snapshot vote, along with the transactions to execute if the proposal passes.
* Invite the community to vote on the proposal.
* Once the Snapshot voting period ends, anyone can propose the transactions by posting a bond.
* After the challenge period, execute the transactions on-chain through the Snapshot interface.
