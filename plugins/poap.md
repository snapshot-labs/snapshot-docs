# POAP

POAP are badges which are non fungible tokens (NFT). Each time you participate in an event, POAP collectors get a unique badge that is supported by a cryptographic record. **** With the POAP plugin you can reward voters on your space with a unique POAP for each of your Proposals on Snapshot.

### **Getting started**

Here is a tutorial to setup POAP plugin on your Snapshot space:&#x20;

* Go to your settings page on Snapshot [https://snapshot.org/#/domain.eth/setting](https://snapshot.org/#/domain.eth/settings) and click on the add plugin.&#x20;

* Search for the POAP module and click on it. You do not need to add anything inside it.  Just  leave it as it is and press on “add”.

* Now save the setting from the top right corner and sign the transactions to save your settings. A POAP plugin has now been successfully added. A POAP plugin will automatically be added to all the new proposals you create. You do not need to add it manually.
* &#x20;**** Whenever you create a new proposal, you must save your Snapshot  proposal ID  from the url of the proposal.

* Create a POAP event by going to the link [https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events). Click on ‘Create new POAP’. Make sure you comply with all the image requirements. After creating the POAP event, you will receive a confirmation email which will indicate that you reply with the amount of codes you need for the attendees of your event. This is not necessary for the plugin to work.\
