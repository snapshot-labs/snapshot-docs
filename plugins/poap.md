# POAP

POAP is a badge which can be acquired by attending events or experiences. In technical terms - a Proof Of Attendance Protocol NFT (non-fungible asset).

With the POAP plugin you can **reward voters** in your space with a unique POAP for each vote they cast on a Snapshot proposal and as a result grow the overall governance participation of your community.&#x20;

## Setup

### 1. Open your space settings on Snapshot <a href="#h_48e007c7d3" id="h_48e007c7d3"></a>

Ensure that you have the permissions required to add new plugins, or reach out to the admins of the space you'd like to add the plugin to.

Scroll down to **Plugins** and click the **Add plugin** button.&#x20;

### &#x20;2. Select the POAP module

A new popup window will show up where you can search for and select the **POAP Module** by simply clicking on it.

No need for additional settings on this step; leave it as-is and click "**Add.**"

&#x20;

Don't forget to save your settings! Go to the top of the page and click **Save.** Confirm the changes by signing the message in your wallet.&#x20;

### 3. Create a new proposal <a href="#h_87ff015410" id="h_87ff015410"></a>

Now when you create a new proposal, the POAP plugin will be automatically added. There is no need to manually add it to each new proposal.

Once the proposal has been created, you can get your **Snapshot proposal ID** from the URL of the proposal. Copy all characters following the `proposal/` in the address box in the browser and save them somewhere - you will need it to link the proposal to your POAP drop.

### 4. Create a POAP drop <a href="#h_0f06ce9fe9" id="h_0f06ce9fe9"></a>

Follow the instructions in POAP's guide [**How Do I Set Up a POAP Drop?** ](https://poap.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9702718846989)but be sure to request "0" mint links.

Take note of your **Drop ID,** as you will need this for the next steps.
