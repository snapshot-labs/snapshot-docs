## How do I receive notifications?

**It's simpler than you think:**

1. **Join** (follow) a Space you would like to receive notifications for

## Managing notifications

You can easily _toggle_, _start_, or _stop_ notifications by sending a message in the chat app:

## Lighthouse

[Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.cx/download?utm_source=snapshot_org) connects you to all your Snapshot spaces and keeps you updated with push notifications whenever a proposal is created or ending soon. Read proposals and comments, and even vote without leaving the app. Everything is cryptographically verified, allowing you to focus on the content that matters.

If you own or manage a space, Lighthouse also enables you to securely communicate with your voters, analyze engagement, and more.
