# Register an ENS domain

{% hint style="warning" %}
**ENS on Ethereum Mainnet**

To register a space on [https://snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org) you need an ENS domain on the **Ethereum Mainnet** even if you want to use Ethereum Testnet or any other network (Binance Smart Chain, xDAI, etc).\
\
However if you want to experiment with the platform you can register a test space on [https://testnet.snapshot.org](https://testnet.snapshot.org) using an ENS on Goerli Testnet.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you already have an ENS domain, feel free to skip this and follow the [.](./ "mention") guide.

### **Creating an ENS Domain**

**1a.** Search for the availability of your name on Snapshot's `Create a space` page

**1b.**  Search for the availability of your name on ENS by following this link:  [https://app.ens.domains/](https://app.ens.domains/)&#x20;

**2.**  If the name is available you will be able to see the 3 steps and the registration fee. Please note that the names with 3 or 4 characters cost considerably more than the names with 5+ characters. \

**3.** Connect your wallet by tapping on the `Connect` button on the top left corner of your screen. Make sure your wallet has enough balance to make the transaction successful and that you selected the Ethereum Mainnet (or Goerli Testnet for the demo page).

**4.** Confirm all transactions for the three steps from your chosen wallet provider. \

**5.** You have now successfully registered on ENS! Additionally, you can also make your Ethereum address point to an ENS name by clicking on ‘Set Reverse Record’ or by going to 'My Account' and then selecting 'Reverse record' and completing the transaction.

**Congratulations! You have created your domain on ENS. You are now ready to create your space on Snapshot.**
