# Sub-spaces

Organizations can create multiple spaces and link them together. This is useful for enforcing different space settings for proposal creation, voting, and execution. For example, instead of having to change the space settings each time you create a proposal, you could create additional spaces with some of your most frequently used settings.

### Setup

You can define a main space, or multiple subspaces, in the Sub-spaces section of the space settings.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)

Do this for both your main space and all subspaces to link them to each other. If you have setup everything correctly they will be displayed on the space page.

### Limits
- A space can add upto 16 sub-spaces
