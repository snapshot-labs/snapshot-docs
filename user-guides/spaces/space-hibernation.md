# Space hibernation

Space Hibernation is placing **inactive** or **incorrectly** **configured** spaces into hibernation mode. This process aims to enhance the user experience.

Space Controller and admins will see this warning message if space has gone into hibernation mode:

#### When does a Space hibernate?

A space will automatically enter hibernation mode if it meets any of the following conditions:

* Inactivity for the past **12 months**.

#### Implications of Hibernation

Once a space is in hibernation mode it is impossible to create new proposals.

#### Reactivating a Space

Navigate to the space settings and click "Reactivate space" at the top of the page.
