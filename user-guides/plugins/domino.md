# Domino Notifications

Domino is a crypto notification system which makes it simple for DAOs to monitor and build automated workflows based on governance data. The Domino plugin allows you to alert space members about new and ended proposals on Snapshot.

## Setup & how it works

### 1. Go to your space settings

In order to add a plugin head to your space settings by clicking **Settings** on your space's page:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (91).png>)

### 2. Add the Domino plugin <a href="#bfec" id="bfec"></a>

Scroll down to the **Plugins** section and click **Add plugin**. Select the plugin you want to add in the pop-up window:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/add-plugin-domino.png>)

### **3. Save your settings**

Scroll up to the top of the page and click **Save** to update your space's settings. The plugin will affect all the newly created proposals.

### 4. Create a proposal

Create a new proposal for your space. You don't need to set anything up for the  Domino notifications, they will be enabled automatically.

### 5. Get notified

Users can now head to the proposal's page and click **any automation** to receive notifications about the proposal.

As a next step users will be redirected to Dominos's [webpage](https://domino.run/explore/apps/snapshot-tmkg6ni3l3r) in order to set up their custom notification rules:

That's it! You're all set up and users can receive direct notifications about the Snapshot proposals :tada:
