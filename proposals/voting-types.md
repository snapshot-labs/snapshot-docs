# Voting types

{% hint style="info" %}
Snapshot supports a number of different voting types and we plan to support many more in the future. If you would like to request a new voting type, please open a feature request here [https://features.snapshot.org/feature-requests](https://features.snapshot.org/feature-requests)
{% endhint %}

## Single choice voting

Each voter may select a single choice to give his total voting power to.

## Approval voting

Each voter may select \("approve"\) any number of choices, each selected choice will receive the full voting power.

## Quadratic voting

Each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices. The results are calculated quadratically, you can test out these calculations here [https://wtfisqf.com/](https://wtfisqf.com/)

## Ranked choice voting \(IRV\)

Each voter may rank any number of choices. Votes are initially counted for each voter's top choice. If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that choice wins. If not, then the choice with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated choice as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a choice has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an "instant runoff" that allows a comparison of the top two choice head-to-head.

## Weighted voting

Each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices. This voting method was first introduced by Float Protocol with [https://scattershot.page](https://scattershot.page/) \(a fork of Snapshot\).
