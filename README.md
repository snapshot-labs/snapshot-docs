## Welcome to Snapshot!

This page intends to give you a brief explanation of what Snapshot is and how it works. It also provides you with all the necessary information to get started.

### Introduction

Snapshot is a decentralized voting system. It provides flexibility on how voting power is calculated for a vote. Snapshot supports various voting types to cater to the needs of organizations. Creating proposals and voting on Snapshot is user-friendly and does not cost gas as the process is performed off-chain.

In short, Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.

### **What’s next?**

Our next guide will take you through the steps of creating a space on Snapshot. It will also take you through the process of registering an ENS domain if you do not have one already. Before you create a space, you might want to look into some of the spaces already created on Snapshot.
